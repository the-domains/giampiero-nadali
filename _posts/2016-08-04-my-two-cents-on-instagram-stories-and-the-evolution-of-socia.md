  Yesterday, Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo sharing app, released it's
  latest platform update: Instagram Stories. It's a new feature that allows you
  to share photos and videos with your followers in a manner that is incredibly
  similar to Snapchat. Like Snapchat, this content will disappear after 24
  hours.
