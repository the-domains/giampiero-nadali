☆ [Samuel Scott][0] for Tech Crunch / Crunch Network:

> "Television" is a marketing channel, not a marketing strategy. If I choose to advertise on television, "advertising" is the strategy, the advertisement itself is the content and "television" is the channel over which I transmit the advertisement. In the same way, "Facebook marketing," "social media marketing" and "content marketing" are not "things." "Facebook" is a marketing channel. "Social media" is a collection of marketing channels. "Content" is a tactic, not a strategy. "Content" is produced in the execution of strategies such as advertising, SEO and publicity.
