title: Who uses label-scanning apps most?
publisher: {}
description: >-
  We have long been interested in the spread of wine label scanning apps here at
  Jancis Robinson.com, with Richard having produced reports on their relative
  efficacy in 2015 and 2016. I thought I would ask the two most successful
  examples, Vivino and Delectable, where they were most frequently used.
