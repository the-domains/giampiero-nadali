# About me

### Digital wine marketer, wine blogger and writer, \#winelover

After a long journey through interactive technologies markets (PCs, software, multimedia, telecommunications, etc.), in 2005 I started with my own wine blog, [Aristide.biz][0], written in Italian language.

It was such a success that, in 2007, I left my day job to join the wine industry, as a web marketing and digital communication consultant.

Now I'm helping wine producers to promote their brands online, leveraging digital innovations and direct communication with customers. I'm founder and partner of [Fermenti Digitali][1], and in a new venture called [Terroir Amarone][2].

I live and work in northern Italy, right among the vineyards that make Valpolicella and Amarone wines, between the city of Verona and Lake Garda.

### Valpolicella, Verona, Italy
