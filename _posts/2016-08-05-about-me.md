# About me
![Nero d'Avola, Sicily](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/abc115a7-ce07-4200-9d65-7dcb557d3ce9.jpg)

## Digital wine marketer, wine blogger & writer, \#winelover  
This site is partly about some content curation, partly about me.

After a long journey through interactive technologies markets (PCs, software, multimedia, telecommunications, etc.), in 2005 I started with my own wine blog, [Aristide.biz][0], written in Italian language.

It was such a success that, in 2007, I left my day job to join the wine industry, as a web marketing and digital communication consultant.

Now I'm helping wine producers to promote their brands online, leveraging digital innovations and direct communication with customers. I'm founder and partner of [Fermenti Digitali][1], and in a new venture called [Terroir Amarone][2].

I live and work in northern Italy, right among the vineyards that make Valpolicella and Amarone wines, between the city of Verona and Lake Garda.

### My English... :-)

Sorry for my English. It's not my mother's language. I'm Italian. And I'm an enthusiast. Eager to write about Italian wines (with other stuff) to foreign friends. So avid that I can't wait for a professional translation. Some tools support my writing "abilities", but there's a lot to learn. And I'm learning. So, please, be patient with me...

### My place: Valpolicella, Verona, Italy

### My Digital Presence

Here in this site, you may explore the many places where my person shows a digital version of his professional life and presence on social media and web sites.
