            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Two Cents on Instagram Stories and the Evolution of Social Platform</h1><p>Yesterday, Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo sharing app, released it's latest platform update: Instagram Stories. It's a new feature that allows you to share photos and videos with your followers in a manner that is incredibly similar to Snapchat.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Treehouse Chocolate's Four Drinking Chocolates</h1><p>Winter may be officially over in the Northern Hemisphere, but that doesn't mean hot chocolate has to disappear from people's radar until temperatures cool again. For some of us, it makes for a viable alternative to coffee in the morning-with some serious sugar and cocoa kick.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/707cfeb12d925cddf6493a0f7a931b18979b2c86.jpg"></article>]]></description>

At the plane's cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground, temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04f6c0633f5a485f90dde99e96cd653a67f86bd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
